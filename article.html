                        <h2>Here are four ways your small business can accept payments in 2020</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>When customers make a buying decision, they’re not just considering the quality and price of your products or services, they’re also evaluating
                            the ease and convenience of the whole buying process. As a business owner, you should offer different payment options to provide the best
                            customer experience and to ensure you receive timely payments.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Credit and Debit Cards</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Data suggests that 75% of customers prefer to pay with a credit or debit card both online and in person. To be able to accept card payments in 
                        your brick-and-mortar store, you’ll need to have a card reader and a merchant account. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Meanwhile, if you want to accept online payments via credit or debit card, you’ll need to have an ecommerce website and a payment gateway, 
                        which encrypts sensitive customer information. For recurring billing, you can have your customers sign up for a subscription billing plan which 
                        will allow you to charge monthly payments on their credit or debit card automatically. This will not only offer customers convenience, but also 
                        ensure that you get paid on time.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        </p>
                        <h3>ACH (Automated Clearing House)</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Automated clearing house (ACH) processing is ideal for recurring payments in a subscription-based model as it allows customers to provide 
                        you with their bank account and routing numbers for electronic payments. 
                        <br>
                        Compared to credit and debit cards, the fees are lower. ACH also offers convenience as it will just require one-time input of information and 
                        the money will be withdrawn as arranged.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Paypal, Stripe, and Square</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>PayPal, Stripe, and Square do not require you to have a merchant account. PayPal and Stripe are commonly used online and allow for seamless 
                        transactions. Meanwhile, Square is the leading choice for brick-and-mortar stores as it lets you turn your smartphone or tablet into a point-of-sale 
                        device by integrating a mag stripe, Bluetooth card reader, or chip. PayPal can also allow you to accept payments in person, but you will have to buy 
                        a card reader and download the app.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Contactless Payment Options</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Contactless payment options let customers pay wirelessly and without having to input a PIN-- they will just have to wave their device or card over 
                        the point-of-sale device.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Visa and Mastercard are offering contactless cards to customers, and there are also mobile wallets compatible with iOS and Android which encourage 
                            customers to use this payment option. As a business owner, you’ll only have to upgrade your equipment with a near-field communication reader or 
                            update your software, depending on your current system.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            At this day and age where technology is constantly evolving and changing the way we do business, it is important to ensure that you are adapting to 
                            stay competitive. 
                        </p>
